		var quote_arr=["Nothing is impossible, the word itself says ,I’m possible.","Whether you think you can or you think you can’t, you’re right.","Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.","Life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90 percent of how I react to it.","If you look at what you have in life, you’ll always have more. If you look at what you don’t have in life, you’ll never have enough.","None of us is as smart as all of us.","I can’t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.","Believe you can and you’re halfway there.","To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your heart.","Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears.","Alone, we can do so little; together we can do so much.","Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.","Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.","I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.","When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it.","The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don’t have any.","The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity.","Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.","Build your own dreams, or someone else will hire you to build theirs.","I have learned over the years that when one’s mind is made up, this diminishes fear."," would rather die of passion than of boredom.","When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left and could say, I used everything you gave me.","The quickest way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in your pocket.","Everything has beauty, but not everyone can see.","The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be"];
